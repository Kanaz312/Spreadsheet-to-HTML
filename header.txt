<p>In keeping with AASHE STARS criteria, Cal Poly proudly promotes CALL, or Campus As a Living Lab, to encourage students to participate in projects related to sustainability on campus. Whether it is teaching students in theater classes how to use materials that can be upcycled or having an engineering class assess monthly energy and water data for campus, Cal Poly has a robust portfolio of sustainability-related CALL projects. Living Lab projects can belong to one or more of the following categories:</p>
