# Spreadsheet_to_HTML
This project is related to a web page I helped create for a project in college. The script asks for a spreadsheet of information
formatted in a specific way, and converts that information into an html output file (in txt form). This html output was then implemented
in an existing website to create a new page for that website. It sorts the information by college of the university, creating a table
for each college, which ultimately creates a tile layout for these projects on the website.
